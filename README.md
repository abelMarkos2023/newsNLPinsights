## Getting started

### After clonning this project first you need to : 

`cd` into your new downloaded folder and run:
- `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`

## Setting up the API

For some reason the meaningcloud.com servers were down and I wasn't able to register  so I had to find another alternative and fortunately I found one textRazop API



### Step 1: Signup for an API key

*

**For the textRazor API**: You can find the API [here](https://www.textrazor.com/docs/rest). Once you create an account with textRazor, you will be given a API key to start using the API. 


```

### Step 4: Environment Variables
Next we need to store our API keys, create .env file in the root of your directory and add this variable in the .env file:
```
APPLICATION_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

```

### Step 5: Using the API

We're ready to go! The API has a lot of different endpoints you can take a look at [here](https://www.textrazor.com/docs/rest#introduction). And you can see how simple it is to use the API

## Next Steps

Once you are hooked up to the textRazor API, you are most of the way there!
